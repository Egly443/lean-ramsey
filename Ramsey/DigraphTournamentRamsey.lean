# Tournament Ramsey numbers

The tournament Ramsey number is the least `n` such that every tournament on `n` vertices contains
a transitive subtournament of a given order `k`. It is bounded above by the classical Erdős–Moser
doubling argument: a tournament on `2m` vertices, where `m` already forces a transitive
`(k + 1)`-subtournament, itself forces a transitive `(k + 2)`-subtournament, by pigeonholing on
which side of an arbitrary vertex `v` a majority of the other vertices falls.

## Main declarations

* `Digraph.ForcesTransitive n k`: every tournament, restricted to any `Finset` of at least `n`
  vertices, has a transitive sub-`Finset` of size exactly `k`.
* `Digraph.erdosMoserBound k`: the closed-form bound `2 ^ (k - 1)`.
* `Digraph.forcesTransitive_bound`: the classical Erdős–Moser doubling induction,
  `ForcesTransitive (erdosMoserBound k) k` for every `k ≥ 1`.
* `Digraph.exists_forcesTransitive`: unconditional existence, for every `k`, of a vertex count
  forcing a transitive `k`-subtournament, i.e. Ramsey's theorem for tournaments.
* `Digraph.tournamentRamseyNumber`: the tournament Ramsey number itself, via `Nat.find` on the
  existence theorem, with its defining spec/minimality/monotonicity lemmas.
* `Digraph.tournamentRamseyNumber_zero`/`_one`/`_two`/`_three`: the four smallest values,
  including the two genuine computations `tournamentRamseyNumber 2 = 2` and
  `tournamentRamseyNumber 3 = 4` (Erdős–Moser / Stearns).

/-! ## The existence induction -/

/-- `ForcesTransitive n k`: every tournament on an ambient vertex type, restricted to any
`Finset` `U` of at least `n` vertices, has a transitive sub-`Finset` of `U` of size exactly `k`.
Stated over an arbitrary `Finset U` of an arbitrary ambient type (rather than fixed to `Fin n`) so
the inductive step below can recurse on a smaller `Finset` of the *same* tournament, with no
re-indexing into a smaller `Fin m`.

`V` is `Type` rather than `Type*`: the whole induction stays within one ambient vertex type fixed
by the outermost quantifier (the recursive step never changes types, only takes smaller `Finset`s
of the same `V`), so universe polymorphism buys nothing here and instead leaves unresolved
universe metavariables at the induction's recursive call. -/

/-- **The inductive step.** Doubling the vertex count lets us find one more vertex for the
transitive subtournament: split the ambient set (minus an arbitrary pivot `v`) into the vertices
`v` beats and the vertices that beat `v`; one side has at least `m` vertices, so the induction
hypothesis finds a transitive `(k + 1)`-subtournament there, and `v` extends it (at the bottom or
top respectively, since it is comparable with every member in the same direction). -/
