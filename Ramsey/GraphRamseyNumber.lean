# The graph-target Ramsey number `R(G, H)`

The classical two-colour Ramsey arrow `n → (r, s)` asks for a monochromatic clique, `K_r` or
`K_s`, inside every red/blue colouring of `K_n`'s edges. Dropping the restriction to complete
targets gives the graph Ramsey number of Chvátal-Harary-style generalized Ramsey theory: given
finite graphs `G` and `H`, `n` arrows `(G, H)` if every red/blue colouring of `K_n`'s edges
contains a red copy of `G` or a blue copy of `H`. Cliques are graphs too, so `R(K_r, K_s)`
recovers the classical Ramsey number exactly (`graphArrow_completeGraph_iff`).

`R(G, H)` is the arrow number (`arrowNumber`) of the two-colour target family
`pairTargets G H` (colour `true` asks for `G`, colour `false` for `H`), so it is a specialisation
of the single primitive in `ArrowNumber.lean`, and it exists for all finite `G`, `H` by
`exists_arrow` (Ramsey's theorem).

## Main declarations

* `SimpleGraph.GraphArrow n G H`: `n` arrows `(G, H)`, i.e. every red/blue edge-colouring of `K_n`
  contains a red copy of `G` or a blue copy of `H`.
* `SimpleGraph.graphArrow_comm`: `GraphArrow` is symmetric in its two targets.
* `SimpleGraph.GraphArrow.mono_graphs`/`mono_vertices`: monotonicity in the targets and in the
  host size.
* `SimpleGraph.graphArrow_completeGraph_iff`: `GraphArrow` specialised to complete-graph targets
  is definitionally the classical clique arrow relation.
* `SimpleGraph.graphArrow_iff_arrow`: `GraphArrow` is `Arrow` for the family `pairTargets`.
* `SimpleGraph.exists_graphArrow`: unconditional existence for finite targets.
* `SimpleGraph.graphRamseyNumber`: the least `n` such that `n` arrows `(G, H)`, with its
  least-number API (`graphRamseyNumber_spec`, `graphRamseyNumber_le_of_graphArrow`,
  `graphArrow_iff_graphRamseyNumber_le`, `lt_graphRamseyNumber_of_not_graphArrow`).
* `SimpleGraph.isContained_completeGraph_two_of_adj`,
  `SimpleGraph.graphRamseyNumber_completeGraph_two_pathGraph_three`: a worked instance,
  `R(K_2, P_3) = 3`, for a target that is not a clique.

## Implementation notes

`GraphArrow` is kept as a readable two-colour interface (`true` for the first colour, `false` for
the second) and is identified with the generic `Arrow` by `graphArrow_iff_arrow`. The number itself
is defined through `arrowNumber`, so no existence proof appears in its statement. The two vertex
types share a universe because the target family `pairTargets` is indexed by `Bool`.

/-- A graph with at least one edge contains a copy of the two-vertex complete graph `K_2`: send
the edge's endpoints to the two vertices of `K_2`. Used by
`graphRamseyNumber_completeGraph_two_pathGraph_three` below to build a red copy of `K_2` out of
any red edge. -/

  (not_cliqueFree_iff_top_isContained 2).mp (cliqueFree_two.not.mpr
    (ne_bot_iff_exists_adj.mpr ⟨x, y, hxy⟩))

/-- **A worked instance for a non-clique target: `R(K_2, P_3) = 3`.** Every red/blue colouring of
`K_3`'s edges contains a red edge or a blue copy of the 3-vertex path `P_3`: if some edge is red,
`isContained_completeGraph_two_of_adj` gives the red `K_2` directly; otherwise every edge of `K_3`
is blue, so the blue label graph is all of `K_3`, which already contains `P_3`. At `n = 2` this
fails: colouring `K_2`'s single edge blue leaves no red edge and only two vertices, too few for a
blue `P_3`. This shows `graphRamseyNumber` behaves correctly on a target that is not a complete
graph, unlike `graphArrow_completeGraph_iff`'s reduction to the classical clique case. -/
