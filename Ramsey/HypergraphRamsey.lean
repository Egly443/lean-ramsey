# Hypergraph Ramsey numbers

This file develops the two-colour Ramsey theory of `k`-uniform hypergraphs (see
`Mathlib.Combinatorics.Hypergraph.Basic`), hypergraphs in which every hyperedge has exactly `k`
vertices, generalising the classical (`k = 2`, ordinary graph) Ramsey arrow relation to hyperedges
of arbitrary fixed size `k`.

Given a `k`-uniform hypergraph `H`, a `Color`-valued colouring of `H`'s hyperedges, and a target
colour, a monochromatic `k`-uniform clique is a vertex subset all of whose `k`-element subsets are
hyperedges of that colour. The two-colour Ramsey arrow `Hypergraph.RamseyProperty n k r s` asserts
that every red/blue colouring of the `k`-element subsets of an `n`-vertex set contains a red
`r`-clique or a blue `s`-clique; `Hypergraph.ramseyNumber` is the least such `n`, given that some
such `n` exists.

## Main declarations

* `Hypergraph.IsKUniform`: every hyperedge of a hypergraph has exactly `k` vertices.
* `Hypergraph.completeKUniform n k`: the complete `k`-uniform hypergraph on `n` vertices, where
  every `k`-element subset of `Fin n` is a hyperedge.
* `Hypergraph.EdgeColoring`: a colouring of a hypergraph's hyperedges by a colour type.
* `Hypergraph.EdgeColoring.MonochromaticClique`, `Hypergraph.EdgeColoring.HasMonochromaticClique`:
  monochromatic `k`-uniform cliques, and their existence at a given size.
* `Hypergraph.EdgeColoring.relabel`, `Hypergraph.EdgeColoring.hasMonochromaticClique_relabel_iff`:
  relabelling a complete `k`-uniform host's vertices along a permutation, and the invariance of
  monochromatic-clique existence under it.
* `Hypergraph.Arrow n k sizes`: every colouring of the `k`-subsets of an `n`-set by a colour type
  `ι` has, for some colour `c`, a `c`-monochromatic clique of size `sizes c`.
* `Hypergraph.ramseyNumber k sizes`: the least such `n` (defined by `sInf`).
* `Hypergraph.RamseyProperty`: the two-colour special case, related to the general one by
  `ramseyProperty_iff_arrow` and `ramseyProperty_iff_arrow_finTwo`.

## Implementation notes

The arrow `Hypergraph.Arrow` and the number `Hypergraph.ramseyNumber` are stated for an arbitrary
colour type with a target size per colour, matching `SimpleGraph.ramseyNumber`; the two-colour
`RamseyProperty` (colours `true`/`false`) is a convenient special case. Existence for general `k`
(the hypergraph Ramsey theorem) is proved by a stepping-up induction not developed in this file,
so `ramseyNumber` is defined with `sInf` and the lemmas that need its true value take an existence
hypothesis. The diagonal case at the end shows existence in the one situation where it is
immediate.

  of arbitrary fixed uniformity, not just graphs.)

A `k`-uniform hypergraph on exactly `k` vertices has exactly one possible hyperedge, the whole
vertex set, so any 2-colouring puts it in some colour, immediately giving a monochromatic
`k`-clique of that colour. This lands on the classical fact that the diagonal `k`-uniform
hypergraph Ramsey number `R_k(k, k)` is exactly `k`, the smallest case where the question is not
vacuous (below `k` vertices there is no `k`-element subset to colour at all). -/
