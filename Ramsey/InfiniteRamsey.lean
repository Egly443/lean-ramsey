# The infinite Ramsey theorem for pairs

Every other file in this series is finite-vertex. This file proves the classical infinite Ramsey
theorem instead: any finite colouring of the edges of the complete graph on an infinite vertex
set contains an infinite monochromatic clique. Nothing in mathlib proves this: the library's other
two results named "Ramsey," Hindman's theorem and the Hales–Jewett theorem, are different
theorems.

## Main declarations

* `SimpleGraph.exists_infinite_monochromatic`: the theorem itself, for `[Finite K]`, a colouring
  `C : TopEdgeLabeling V K`, and an infinite `X0 : Set V`, there is a colour `k` and an infinite
  `H ⊆ X0` with `(C.labelGraph k).IsClique H`.

## Proof

A thin corollary of `InfiniteRamseyKUniform.lean`'s general `k`-uniform infinite Ramsey theorem, at
`k = 2`: pairs from an infinite set are exactly `2`-element `Finset`s, so it only remains to bridge
vocabulary between `TopEdgeLabeling`'s `V → V → K`-shaped colouring of edges and the general
theorem's `Finset V → K`-shaped colouring of `2`-element subsets. That bridge (`pairColouring`,
`pairColouring_eq`) lives in `MonochromaticKUniform.lean`, not here: it is finite/infinite-agnostic
content in its own right, shared with that file's other use of it (relating `u = 2` monochromatic
`Finset`-cliques to ordinary graph cliques in the finite case).
`exists_infinite_monochromatic` unpacks the general theorem's `col`/`H`/`hmono` directly into the
`IsClique` conclusion.

## Implementation notes

Stated for `V K : Type` rather than `Type*`, inherited from `ExistsInfiniteMonochromaticKUniform`'s
own universe restriction (see `InfiniteRamseyKUniform.lean`'s implementation notes); a
universe-polymorphic version of the general theorem, and hence of this corollary, is not currently
available.

  (Ramsey's original theorem is stated and proved for infinite sets; the finite case is derived
  from it in the same paper.)
