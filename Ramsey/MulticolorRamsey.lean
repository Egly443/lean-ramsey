# The multicolour clique Ramsey arrow, and its reduction to the two-colour case

`MulticolorCliqueArrow` specialises the generic `SimpleGraph.Arrow` relation (from the file
preceding it in the series) to a complete host and constant clique targets, one per colour.

## Background

The classical two-colour Ramsey arrow `n → (r, s)` generalises to `k` colours: `n → (n_1, ...,
n_k)` says every `k`-colouring of `K_n`'s edges contains, in some colour `c`, a monochromatic
`K_{n_c}`. This file states that relation (`MulticolorCliqueArrow`, indexed by an arbitrary
`Fin k` colour palette) and proves its headline theorem: **unconditional existence, for every
`k` and every tuple of clique sizes**, via the classical recursive argument
`R(n_1, ..., n_k) ≤ R(n_1, R(n_2, ..., n_k))`.

## The argument

Induction on `k`.

* `k = 0`: vacuous. No colouring by the *empty* colour type `Fin 0` can exist on a host with at
  least one edge, so the arrow relation holds trivially (`exists_multicolorCliqueArrow_zero`).
* `k + 1`: given `sizes : Fin (k + 1) → Nat`, split off colour `0` (target size `sizes 0`) from
  the rest (`Fin.tail sizes : Fin k → Nat`). By the induction hypothesis, some `m` makes
  `MulticolorCliqueArrow m (Fin.tail sizes)` hold. By the *two-colour* case — taken here as an
  explicit hypothesis `h2`, since proving it is a separate, much larger piece of
  neighbourhood-counting combinatorics entirely out of this file's scope (the classical Ramsey
  theorem itself) — some `N` makes `MulticolorCliqueArrow N ![sizes 0, m]` hold. Given any
  `(k+1)`-colouring `C` of `K_N`,
  merge colours `1..k` into a single colour `1` (colour `0` stays `0`) and apply the two-colour
  hypothesis to the merged colouring:
  - colour `0` of the merged colouring is exactly colour `0` of `C` — a colour-`0` clique of size
    `sizes 0` there finishes immediately.
  - colour `1` of the merged colouring is a set `S` of `m` vertices all of whose `C`-colours
    (among themselves) are `≠ 0`. Pulling `C` back along an embedding `Fin m ↪ Fin N` with range
    `S`, and dropping the (never-occurring) colour `0` via `Fin.pred`, gives a genuine
    `k`-colouring of `K_m`. The induction hypothesis, applied to *this* colouring, produces a
    monochromatic clique in some colour `c' : Fin k`, i.e. (shifting back by one, `c'.succ`) a
    colour-`c'.succ` clique of size `sizes c'.succ` inside `S`, hence inside `K_N` — done.

**Given the two-colour case as a hypothesis rather than the classical Ramsey theorem itself**,
this file's main theorem, `exists_multicolorCliqueArrow_of_exists_two`, is a genuinely more
general induction principle than what it specialises to: *any* proof that the classical
two-colour clique arrow always eventually holds lifts, mechanically, to every finite colour
count. Discharging `h2` with the two-colour theorem (`MulticolorRamseyUnconditional.lean`) gives
the unconditional `∀ k sizes, ∃ n, MulticolorCliqueArrow n sizes`.

## Design notes for reviewers

* The two-colour merge uses `Fin 2` (`0`/`1`) rather than a bespoke two-element colour type, to
  keep this file's induction independent of any particular two-colour formalisation.
