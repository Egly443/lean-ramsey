# Closing the multicolour clique arrow's two-colour gap

`exists_multicolorCliqueArrow_of_exists_two` takes the classical two-colour Ramsey arrow's
eventual existence as an explicit hypothesis `h2`, rather than proving it, so that it applies to
any proof of the two-colour case. This file discharges that
hypothesis from `exists_ramseyProperty`, producing the fully unconditional multicolour clique
Ramsey arrow existence theorem.

The only work is bridging vocabulary: `RamseyProperty` is stated via a `Bool`-indexed
`SimpleGraph.TopEdgeLabeling` and the `IsNClique`-based `HasRedClique`/`HasBlueClique` predicates,
whereas `MulticolorCliqueArrow` is stated via a `Fin 2`-indexed `SimpleGraph.EdgeLabeling` and the
`IsContained` relation `⊑`.

## Main declarations

* `SimpleGraph.hasRedClique_iff_top_isContained`, `SimpleGraph.hasBlueClique_iff_top_isContained`:
  the `HasRedClique`/`HasBlueClique`-to-`⊑` bridge, restating `not_cliqueFree_iff_top_isContained`
  for the two-colour vocabulary of `RamseyProperty`.
* `SimpleGraph.ramseyProperty_iff_arrow`: `RamseyProperty n r s` is exactly the generic `Arrow`
  relation (`ArrowSemantics.lean`) at `ι := Bool` and complete-graph targets — making explicit that
  `RamseyProperty` and `MulticolorCliqueArrow` are two colour-index-shaped views of one relation,
  not independently-invented formalisms.
* `SimpleGraph.two_colour_ramsey_gives_multicolorCliqueArrow`: `exists_ramseyProperty` instantiates
  `exists_multicolorCliqueArrow_of_exists_two`'s hypothesis `h2`.
* `SimpleGraph.exists_multicolorCliqueArrow`: the fully unconditional multicolour clique Ramsey
  arrow existence theorem, for every finite colour count and every tuple of clique sizes.

## Proof outline

Given `C : (⊤ : SimpleGraph (Fin n)).EdgeLabeling (Fin 2)`, recolour it to a `Bool`-indexed
two-colouring `Cbool := C.compRight finTwoEquiv : TwoColoring (Fin n)` and apply
`exists_ramseyProperty`'s witness at `Cbool`. This produces a red or blue clique of `Cbool`, which
transports (via `not_cliqueFree_iff_top_isContained`) into the `⊑`-shape `MulticolorCliqueArrow`
demands, at the `Fin 2` colour `finTwoEquiv.symm` sends `true`/`false` to.

`MulticolorCliqueArrow` specialises `Arrow` to `Fin k`-indexed colours
(`MulticolorRamsey.lean`),
made explicit here for `RamseyProperty`'s own concrete `Bool`-indexed shape. `RamseyProperty`
itself stays defined directly on `TwoColoring`/`HasRedClique`/`HasBlueClique` rather than as a
literal `Arrow` instance, since its existence proof (`RamseyExistence.lean`, `BinomialBound.lean`)
is a recursive neighbourhood-counting argument genuinely specific to that concrete shape; this
lemma records that the two formulations coincide, rather than requiring every future two-colour
argument to re-derive the connection itself. -/

and transporting the resulting monochromatic clique with `hasRedClique_iff_top_isContained`/
`hasBlueClique_iff_top_isContained`. -/
