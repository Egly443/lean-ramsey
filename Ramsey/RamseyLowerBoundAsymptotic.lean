# The classical closed-form lower bound `2 ^ (k / 2) ≤ ramseyNumber ![k, k]`

`RamseyLowerBound.lean`'s `lt_ramseyNumber_of_choose_lt` is a general counting lemma needing a
numeric hypothesis, `n.choose k * 2 < 2 ^ (k.choose 2)`, supplied at the call site. This file
discharges that hypothesis at `n = 2 ^ (k / 2)`, recovering the textbook closed form: for `k ≥ 3`,
`ramseyNumber ![k, k] ≥ 2 ^ (k / 2)`.

The classical real-exponent argument bounds `n.choose k ≤ n ^ k / k!` and shows `n ^ k < k! *
2 ^ (k.choose 2 - 1)` at `n = 2 ^ (k / 2)`, which reduces, after cancelling the shared power of
two between `n ^ k` and `2 ^ (k.choose 2)`, to `2 ^ (k / 2 + 1) < k!`, true once `k` is large
enough for factorial growth to overtake exponential growth. Discretizing `k / 2` by `Nat`
truncation, rather than the real number `k / 2`, shifts exactly where "large enough" starts: for
even `k` this reduction is exact and the counting bound applies down to `k = 4`; for odd `k` the
reduction is stronger than needed (the shared power of two cancels completely, leaving `2 < k!`,
true for every `k ≥ 3`), but the hypothesis `k ≤ n` of `lt_ramseyNumber_of_choose_lt` itself fails
at `k = 3, 5` (`2 ^ (3 / 2) = 2 < 3` and `2 ^ (5 / 2) = 4 < 5`). Those two cases, and only those
two, are covered instead by the trivial bound `ramseyNumber ![k, k] ≥ k` (`le_ramseyNumber_self`),
which is itself at least as strong as `2 ^ (k / 2) ≤ k` whenever that holds.

## Main declarations

* `SimpleGraph.le_ramseyNumber_self`: the trivial bound `k ≤ ramseyNumber ![k, k]`, since with fewer
  than `k` vertices there is no `k`-subset of any colour to find.
* `SimpleGraph.two_pow_half_le_ramseyNumber`: the closed-form bound itself, `2 ^ (k / 2) ≤
  ramseyNumber ![k, k]` for `k ≥ 3`.

## Implementation notes

Both parities are handled at once: `k / 2 * k ≤ k.choose 2 + k / 2` (since `2 * (k / 2) ≤ k`) and
`2 ^ (k / 2 + 1) ≤ 2 ^ (k - 1) < k!` (`two_pow_pred_lt_factorial`, a direct induction from `k = 3`).

`two_mul_choose_two` (`2 * n.choose 2 = n * (n - 1)`, an equality, unlike the library's own
`Nat.choose_two_right : n.choose 2 = n * (n - 1) / 2`) is proved via
`Nat.descFactorial_eq_factorial_mul_choose` rather than by clearing the division in
`choose_two_right`, since it avoids having to separately establish `2 ∣ n * (n - 1)`: the
`descFactorial` route gives the doubled identity directly, without division ever entering the
picture.

/-! ### The closed-form bound -/

/-- The classical closed-form lower bound. For `k ≥ 3`, `ramseyNumber ![k, k] ≥ 2 ^ (k / 2)`. If
`2 ^ (k / 2) ≤ k` (only `k = 3, 5` under `Nat` truncation), this is weaker than the trivial
`le_ramseyNumber_self`; otherwise it follows from `lt_ramseyNumber_of_choose_lt` via
`choose_pow_half_mul_two_lt`. -/

/-- A worked instance: at `k = 6`, the closed form gives `ramseyNumber ![6, 6] ≥ 2 ^ 3 = 8`. The
exact value of `R(6, 6)` is a well-known open problem (see Radziszowski's dynamic survey *Small
Ramsey Numbers* for the current bounds); this bound is far below it, but it is proved
unconditionally, with no case-by-case combinatorial search. -/
