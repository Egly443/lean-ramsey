# Ramsey's theorem for finitely many colours

For a finite colour type `ι` and target sizes `n : ι → ℕ`, every `ι`-colouring of the edges of a
large enough complete graph has, for some colour `c`, a clique of size `n c` all of whose edges have
colour `c`.

The proof is the direct induction on the total size `∑ c, n c`, for all colour counts at once,
rather than a reduction to the two-colour case. If some `n c = 0` there is nothing to prove.
Otherwise fix a vertex `v`. By the pigeonhole principle, some colour `c` occurs on at least `N c`
of the edges at `v`, where `N c` works for the sizes `n` with `n c` lowered by one. Inside that
colour-`c` neighbourhood we find either a colour-`d` clique of size `n d` for some `d ≠ c`, or a
colour-`c` clique of size `n c - 1`, which `v` extends.

## Main declarations

* `SimpleGraph.IsRamseyValid V n`: every `ι`-labelling of the complete graph on `V` has, for some
  colour `c`, a `c`-monochromatic clique of size `n c`.
* `SimpleGraph.IsRamseyValid.of_embedding`: the property passes to larger vertex types.
* `SimpleGraph.exists_isRamseyValid`: **Ramsey's theorem**: some `N` makes every vertex type with at
  least `N` elements Ramsey-valid.
