# Schur's theorem

Every finite colouring of the positive naturals has a monochromatic solution to `x + y = z`.
Classical additive Ramsey theory, and the natural companion to Van der Waerden's theorem (already
in mathlib as a corollary of Hales–Jewett, `Combinatorics.exists_mono_homothetic_copy`): the two
are the standard textbook pairing for "Ramsey theory of the integers," of which mathlib currently
has only one half.

## Main declarations

* `SimpleGraph.schur`: for every colour count `r`, there is a threshold `N` such that every
  `r`-colouring of the positive naturals has `x, y, z ≤ N` all the same colour with `x + y = z`.

## Proof

The classical derivation from graph Ramsey theory (Schur's original 1916 argument, predating even
the naming of "Ramsey theory"). Given a colouring `c` of the positive naturals, colour the edges of
`K_N` by `(i, j) ↦ c |i - j|`, the difference colouring. A monochromatic triangle `{a, b, d}` in
this edge-colouring, sorted `p < q < t`, gives `c (q - p) = c (t - q) = c (p - t) = c (t - p)`, and
`(q - p) + (t - q) = t - p`: a monochromatic Schur triple. The monochromatic triangle itself comes
directly from this series' `exists_multicolorCliqueArrow`, instantiated at constant clique target
`3` for `r` colours; `completeGraph_isContained_iff_orderedIsContained` (`OrderedRamsey.lean`)
then presents it already sorted, so no case analysis on the order of its vertices is needed.

/-- Worked example: the classical Schur number `S(2) = 5`, in the form that every `2`-colouring of
`{1, ..., 5}` has a monochromatic solution to `x + y = z`. Unlike `schur`, whose threshold `N` is
produced non-effectively from Ramsey's theorem, this bound is small enough to check by direct
case analysis over all `64` colourings and `216` candidate triples. -/
