# Extending a graph by one new vertex

This file defines `SimpleGraph.addVertex`, the universal way to extend a graph `G : SimpleGraph
V` by a single brand-new vertex with an arbitrary prescribed neighbourhood among the old
vertices: `G.addVertex N` lives on `Option V`, the universal one-point extension of `V`, with the
new vertex `none` adjacent to exactly the vertices in `N`. Every one-vertex extension of `G` (up
to an isomorphism fixing `G`) is of this form for some choice of `N`.

This is a different construction from `SimpleGraph.replaceVertex`: `replaceVertex`
relabels one *existing* vertex's neighbourhood within the same vertex type `V`, while
`addVertex` enlarges the vertex type itself by one new element. `Option V` (rather than, say,
`V ⊕ Unit`) is used for the new vertex type to match `SimpleGraph.induceUnivIso`-style
conventions elsewhere in `Mathlib.Combinatorics.SimpleGraph`; `V ⊕ Unit` would be an equally
defensible choice and reviewers may prefer it.

## Main declarations

* `SimpleGraph.addVertex`: the one-vertex extension.
* `SimpleGraph.decidableRelAddVertexAdj`: `(G.addVertex N).Adj` is decidable whenever `G.Adj` and
  membership in `N` are.
* `SimpleGraph.neighborSet_addVertex_none`, `SimpleGraph.mem_neighborSet_addVertex_some`: the new
  and old vertices' neighbourhoods in `G.addVertex N`, in terms of `G`'s own neighbourhoods and
  `N`.
* `SimpleGraph.addVertex_isContained`: adding a vertex never removes structure.
* `SimpleGraph.CliqueFree.of_addVertex`: the deletion direction — if a one-vertex extension of
  `G` is `n`-clique-free, so was `G`.
* `SimpleGraph.Iso.addVertex`: `addVertex` transports along a graph isomorphism.

/-- Concrete instance of `mem_neighborSet_addVertex_some`: extending the two-vertex complete graph
by a new vertex adjacent only to old vertex `0`, old vertex `0`'s neighbours become the old
neighbour `1` together with the new vertex, while the new vertex itself and `0` stay non-adjacent
(the graph has no loops). -/
