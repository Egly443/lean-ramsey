# Clique-saturated graphs

A graph `G` is `n`-clique-*edge*-saturated if it is `n`-clique-free but adding any missing edge
creates an `n`-clique, the classical `K_n`-saturated graph of extremal graph theory. This file
also names the vertex-addition analogue, `SimpleGraph.CliqueVertexSaturated`: `n`-clique-free, but
extending by any new vertex (with any neighbourhood among the old vertices) always creates an
`n`-clique.

## Naming

`CliqueVertexSaturated` is not called `CliqueVertexCritical`: "vertex-critical" is standard
graph-theory terminology for *chromatic* criticality (`G` is `k`-vertex-critical if `χ(G) = k` but
`χ(G - v) < k` for every vertex `v`), a different notion from the one defined here. Naming this
predicate after `CliqueEdgeSaturated` instead avoids that collision and makes the
vertex-addition/edge-addition parallel explicit.

This file imports `Ramsey.SimpleGraphLemmas` (for
`SimpleGraph.cliqueFree_iso_iff` and `SimpleGraph.Iso.supEdge`) and
`Ramsey.SimpleGraphAddVertex` (for `SimpleGraph.addVertex` and its
isomorphism transport); in a real PR series these would instead be ordinary
`Mathlib.Combinatorics.SimpleGraph` imports once those earlier files have landed upstream.

## Main declarations

* `SimpleGraph.CliqueVertexSaturated`: `n`-clique-free, and every one-vertex extension creates an
  `n`-clique.
* `SimpleGraph.CliqueEdgeSaturated`: `n`-clique-free, and every one-edge extension between
  *distinct, non-adjacent* vertices creates an `n`-clique, the classical `K_n`-saturated graph.
* Both notions only depend on `G` up to isomorphism
  (`SimpleGraph.cliqueVertexSaturated_iso_iff`, `SimpleGraph.cliqueEdgeSaturated_iso_iff`).
* `SimpleGraph.not_cliqueFree_sup_edge_iff_not_cliqueFreeOn_commonNeighbors`: the common-
  neighbourhood characterisation of when adding an edge between non-adjacent `v`, `w` creates an
  `(n + 2)`-clique: exactly when `v` and `w`'s common neighbourhood already has an `n`-clique.

vertex — whatever neighbourhood among the old vertices that vertex is given — always creates an
`n`-clique. The vertex-addition analogue of `n`-clique-saturation
(`SimpleGraph.CliqueEdgeSaturated`, the edge-addition analogue). -/

/-- `G` is `n`-clique-edge-saturated — a `K_n`-saturated graph in the classical extremal graph
theory sense: it is `n`-clique-free, but adding any missing edge between *distinct* vertices
creates an `n`-clique. The edge-addition counterpart of `SimpleGraph.CliqueVertexSaturated`.

The `v ≠ w` hypothesis is essential, not merely a convenience: without it the universal
quantifier's `v = w` instance is always available (a graph is always non-adjacent to itself,
`edge v v = ⊥`, so that instance demands `¬G.CliqueFree n`), directly contradicting the first
conjunct for every nonempty `V` — the predicate would be satisfiable only by the empty graph. -/

section CommonNeighborsCharacterisation

/-- **The common-neighbourhood characterisation of edge-saturation.** Given `G` is
`(n + 2)`-clique-free and `v ≠ w` are non-adjacent, adding the edge `v w` creates an
`(n + 2)`-clique exactly when `v` and `w`'s common neighbourhood already has an `n`-clique: any
`(n + 2)`-clique of `G ⊔ edge v w` must use the new edge (else it would already be an
`(n + 2)`-clique of `G`), so it consists of `v`, `w`, and an `n`-clique of `G` inside their common
neighbourhood — and conversely, `v` and `w` together with any such `n`-clique give one directly. -/

/-- **The complete graph is edge-saturated once it is too small to hold the target clique.**
`⊤ : SimpleGraph (Fin (n + 1))` has only `n + 1` vertices, so it is `(n + 2)`-clique-free; and
since it is complete, it has no non-adjacent pair to check, so the saturation condition holds
vacuously. A minimal witness that `CliqueEdgeSaturated` is satisfiable by a nonempty graph. -/
